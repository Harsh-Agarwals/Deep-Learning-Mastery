    "## Basics of Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "What comes to your mind when you hear the term Neural? I am sure it reminds you of something related to the Human brain. That is actually the place this term Neural Network came from. Our brain is actually a **complex mesh network of \"neurons\"** which processes the incoming information to it and passes it to the next neuron untill it reaches the receptor. This simple process makes our brain control the body functions, including thought, emotion, response, sense, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here is a simple image of our brain, showing different sections responsible for response to different senses.\n",

    "\n",
    "**_Neural Network shares a similar story!_**\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Network lays the foundation of the modern AI, from your _Google translate_ to your phone's _voice assistant_, from your mail _spam filter_ to the keyboard next words _auto suggestion_, from the _self-driving cars_ to the _ChatGPT_, from _image generation_ softwares(like Midjourney, Dalle) to your Netflix _Recommender system_, and much more...\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the way brain wires itself to process lots of information, thereby producing a useful output which stimulates responses based on the sensory receptor(smell, hearing, vision, etc) it sourced to, Neural Network too **computes hundreds of thousands of calculation**, processes the information it was given and outputs a useful result for the information. And just how our brain processes information related to hearing, vision, language understanding, logics, etc, Neural Networks strange can process similar information using hundreds of neurons, doing large number of mathematical calculations.\n",

    "_In this notebook, we will be going through the basic working of Neural Networks, mathematical intuition behind its working, will build Neural Network of our own, will add lots of complexity to our basic network to make it process large dataset producing better results and finally we will study different variations of Neural Networks for different tasks. So, let's get started!_\n",
    "\n",
    "### So, here is a simple definition of Neural Network!\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network consist of neurons which are simply a **mathematical function** taking some input, doing some calculations and outputting the value of the function. A NN can have _few neurons to hundreds of thousands of neuron_. Together, they make up a very strong model that works similar to the brain and have the capacity to process any kind of information(text, voice, languages, tabular, logical, etc), given the correct _NN architecture_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Universal function Approximator:** A Neural Network is popularly known as the **Black Box**, meaning something that can process and approximate anything you put inside the box. So, when we send to the NN a simple data table with X as random numbers and y mapping X to it its square without specifying the function, the NN will figure out the squared function mapping. Similarly, it can figure out any kind of data mapping, approximating for any kind of function, hence abbreviated as _the Universal function approximator_.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathemical intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "_Here is the simple picture to understand an artificial neuron:_\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/artificial_neuron.png\" style=\"margin: 2rem auto; width: 400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "_Here, the neuron takes inputs(some weights are associated with each input), process the information inside mathematically, and outputs the final value._\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is an image of a simple Neural Network, with each node acting as a neuron, recieving weighted inputs from all the nodes of the previous layer and providing it's weighted output to all the nodes of the subsequent layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/simple_nn.png\" style=\"margin: 2rem auto; width: 200px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "_Here, the input layer consists of input neurons(3 here) taking input data, and output layer consists of output neurons(3 outputs). This Neural Network also has a **hidden layer** with its own neurons(4) making the network more complex and processing the data better (as now more complex calculation are associated with the network, making it unleashing more properties associated with the data)._\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple example, let's say we have an input data consisting of housing prices with data properties like number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, total squared area, etc. So the hidden layers will figure out the _complex properties associated_ with the input layer, like more prices if area is more, more price if number of bedrooms is more, etc using some complex mathematical function like (for example): $$node\\_1 = \\sqrt{w1*number\\_bedrooms + w2*number\\_bathrooms}$$\n",
    "Each node will perform some complex calculations w.r.t its inputs, associating neuron with some particular hidden properties. These hidden properties then plays a very crucial role in understanding the data, modelling it to learn the **X->y mapping**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Now, lets look at the working of a Neural Network_\n",
    "\n",
    "A neuron, as we discussed earlier, takes weighted inputs from all its precedent layer, wrap it in some function to give output. _And here is how the whole network works_:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First the architechture of the NN is decided (which includes number of hidden layers and number of nodes in each hidden layers)\n",
    "- Since each node of a particular layer will connect to each nodes of the next layer, **weights** of each of the connection is randomly assigned to neurons of each layer, and **bias** is also assigned to each layer nodes.\n",
    "- Calculation from the input layer to the output layer are performed for each layer and its nodes. This process is called **Forward Propagation**.\n",
    "- Final output prediction is generated.\n",
    "- The above process is repeated for all training examples **(in batch, mini-batches or stochastically(one at a time))**, and at the end we define a **Cost function** which measure the collective loss of all the example/s in the batch. There are different cost functions associated with different tasks, like _log loss for classification, squared error for regression_, etc.\n",
    "- Once the cost function is calculated, we _update all the weights and biases_ for every layer in the **backward propagation** step(just like forward propagation, but backwards). This process is the optimization step which aims to _**update and optimize weight and bias**_ to the value that, in the forward pass, produces the value closest to our real value, making correct prediction. There are many **optimization algorithm**, **Gradient Descent** being the most famous and used one.\n",
    "- _**Since it will take many forward and backward passes to reach the optimized value of weights and biases, the above processes(forward propagation, cost updation and backward propagation) are performed in many iterations, eventually reaching the minima.**_\n",

There are **two functions(linear function and activation function)** inside the neuron that computes the input one after the other, outputting the final result. _Let's look at both the functions in detail:_\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear function:** It is a simple function that computes the **linear combination** of all the inputs, adding the bias to it at the end. This is useful as it _tells how much focus our this particular neuron(which gets understanding a particular property over time) has to give to the output of each of the previous neurons_. Bias term adjust the output of the linear function toward positive or negative side of the activation function, improving model's flexibility and boosting it's performance (don't worry, we will study this part later). _So, the equation for a particular data(j) instance having n columns is:_\n",

    "$$\\hat{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(1, m)}$$ \n",
    "for m examples. We will later learn how to initialize these weights and bias, and how to set up a particular NN architecture. _Now we pass this output $\\hat{y}$ to the activation function._\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activation function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are activation function important? This might come to your mind that why do we need an another function if we had already worked out on one function. And what is the role of this activation function in this step? So, here we go-\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a Neural Network with 10 hidden layers, and for each layer we just calculate the linear combination of inputs. We will have $\\hat{y}^1 = w^1X + b, \\hat{y}^2 = w^2\\hat{y}^1 + b = w^1w^2X + b, ...$ So, we will have $\\hat{y}^{10} = w^1w^2...w^{10}X + b$ which is equivalent to $wX + b$. **So, neural network here failed to learn the complex non-linear relationships.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we see these hidden layers is not affecting our final results much. It is equivalent to having one hidden layer, and training it well to produce linear result. **_So, this tells us that we need an another function, that does not just produce a linear function, rather some other function, that makes deeper layers output useful to the final output_**. _Here comes the concept of **Non-liner activations**. These are the activation functions that we pass our linear functions output to, and the output makes sure that every layer gives a non linear output, helpful in finding different properties associated with the data in the middle layers._\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason why we use non-linear activation function in each neuron is because of the backpropagation step. _In the backpropagation step, we calculate the derivative of outputs of each neuron, and this derivative helps in the optimization step using Gradient Descent_. So we chose such non-linear activation function that have steeper derivatives, that can **optimize gradient descent faster**. Also, since the outputs (specially in classification tasks) are discrete, we chose the final function as the one closer to our output range. Usually we chose **Sigmoid function** or **Softmax function** for the final layer of the NN with discrete output, and **linearReLU** for regression problems. In the middle layers, we generally use **ReLU, leaky ReLU, tanh or sigmoid function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**These functions provides non-linearity to our outputs, which helps in learning the complex non-linear relationships, and also helps with faster optimization during backpropagation.** Here are some activation functions for reference:_ These can be referenced <a href=\"activation.py\">here</a>.\n",

In this section, let's see an in-depth intuition of working of the backpropagation algorithm and different optimizing algorithms. As discussed earlier, backpropagation starts with the last step of the forward propagation, which is calculating the cost function.

But before these, we calculate the derivative of the cost function. \n",
