### Neural Networks from Scratch

# This part of the repository will contains different building blocks of Neural Network, all made from Scratch in modular programming structure (classes and multiple files).


# This will contains:
- Simple Neural Network
- Forward Propagation
- Backpropagation
- Various Cost functions (binary cross entropy, log loss, etc)
- Various Non-linear activations (tanh, sigmoid, etc)
- Different kind of optimization (Adam, momentum, etc)
- Gradient Descent variations (SGD, Mini-Batch, etc)
- Deep Neural Networks
- Dropout layers
- Batch Normalization
- Graphical analysis of NN
- Runtime analysis
- Running NN on GPUs
